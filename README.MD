## Webpack Boiler Plate:

Webpack 4 boiler plate to kickstart my projects and you can use it too :). Much of the boiler plate is built upon [Tania Rascia's Webpack boiler plate](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate).

I included the Webpack DLL plugin and made a few customizations from the [origin](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate).

### Installation

```
https://github.com/Frontendry/webpack-boiler-plate

npm i

```

### DLL Creation

Make sure to add the files to be dll'ed on config/webpack.dll.js. Then...

```
npm start

```

### Dev Server

```
npm run dev

```

### Production Build

```
npm run build

```

Enjoy!!!
